WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
Resolution: For a complete and accurate timing signoff, report_timing_summary must be run after route_design. Alternatively, route_design can be run with the -timing_summary option to enable a complete timing signoff at the end of route_design.
WARNING: [Route 35-3426] Critical methodology violations exist in the design which may contribute to timing failures: TIMING-17
Resolution: Review the critical violations in methodology report if available, otherwise run report_methodology to generate and review the report.
